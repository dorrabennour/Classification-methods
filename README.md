# Classification-methods
It is difficult to detect Alzheimer's disease at an early stage. Electroencephalography has many advantages over other technologies for monitoring brain activity. We have electroencephalogram data from 50 people, 28 of whom have Alzheimer's disease (AD individuals), and 22 of whom have no pathology in their brain activity (SCI individuals). We will try to develop a classifier that will allow us to identify whether an individual has Alzheimer's disease or not. We will thus try to answer the question: How to efficiently classify AD and SCI individuals using the 4 frequency Alpha Beta Delta Theta EEG data?
